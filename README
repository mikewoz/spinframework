About
-----

The SPIN Framework allows for 'Spatial Interaction' in a networked system of virtual environments. Tools are provided for high-level layout of 3D content, visualization, and distribution of state over networks. Possible application areas include:

    * Immersive Environments / Virtual Reality
    * Collaborative 3D authoring and editing
    * Telepresence
    * Visualization
    * Distributed Performance Art
    * Online Game / Metaverse Engines

One of the key features of the system is that spatial layout and editing is done in real time rather than in an offline process. This allows for rapid prototyping of virtual environments and interaction. Network communication is achieved through OpenSoundControl (OSC), allowing the use several existing systems for control flow, including Pure Data, Max/MSP, Processing, etc. The framework provides generic mechanisms for spatial manipulation, based on geometric events (movement, intersection, incidence, etc.), so a number of interaction paradigms can be explored.

A number of audio/video/image formats are supported by means of the OpenSceneGraph (OSG) library and its extensible plugin architecture. Additionally, powerful rendering and visualization solutions can be realized, including multi-projector configurations, and distortion correction for cylindrical or hemispheric displays.

Ultimately, the SPIN Framework allows for the creation of collaborative environments where several distributed users can share and interact with immersive 3D content.
