#  Easing Equations v1.5
#  May 1, 2003
#  (c) 2003 Robert Penner, all rights reserved. 
#  This work is subject to the terms in 
#  http://www.robertpenner.com/easing_terms_of_use.html.  
#  
#  These tweening functions provide different flavors of 
#  math-based motion under a consistent API. 
#  
#  Types of easing:
#  
#	  Linear
#	  Quadratic
#	  Cubic
#	  Quartic
#	  Quintic
#	  Sinusoidal
#	  Exponential
#	  Circular
#	  Elastic
#	  Back
#	  Bounce
#
#  Changes:
#  1.5 - added bounce easing
#  1.4 - added elastic and back easing
#  1.3 - tweaked the exponential easing functions to make endpoints exact
#  1.2 - inline optimizations (changing t and multiplying in one step)
#        -- thanks to Tatsuo Kato for the idea
#  
#  Discussed in Chapter 7 of 
#  Robert Penner's Programming Macromedia Flash MX
#  (including graphs of the easing equations)
