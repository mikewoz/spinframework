2012-03-05 : spinframework 0.3.10
---------------------------------
This release is in the development series 0.3.x that has an unstable API. 

New features:

* added option of reading command line args from file: ~/.spinFramework/args
* added initial PointCloud node
* added GeometryNode
* xcode project
* SharedVideoTexture: allow set/get renderbin

Bugs fixed:

* fixed boost linking for spinserver and spinviewer app
* added missing boost libraries to Makefile.am
* fixed texture loading for Ubuntu using OSG 3.0.1 from package (by specifying the correct plugin path)
* added /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/lib64 to LDFLAGS to test on Ubuntu Precise
* switched to new boost.m4 script
* changed ifdefs in sharedvideonode to prevent errors if wrappers are generated in linux
* set video textures to play by default
* set OSG-specific library path in one_step_build.sh
* delete SharedVideoNode
* add Makefile.am for completion dir
* fixed orbit example's Makefile
* added boost-program-options library, since the newest python 2.6 on Lucid uses an updated libutil, which requires boost-program-options


2012-01-13 : spinframework 0.3.4
--------------------------------
This release is in the development series 0.3.x that has an unstable API. 

New features:

* Enclose everything in the spin namespace
* four-screen cube
* dome distorsion to camera config files
* Library renamed to libspin-0.3
* add pkg-config file
* update spatosc arguments, since spatosc takes OSC urls (ie, osc.udp://host:port) instead of host and port arguments separately
* changed spinserver's txAddr to a list of addresses, so we can use multiple UDP unicast connections instead of multicast (important on wacky networks that don't permit multicast)
* big restructuring of command-line arguments, allowing for manual override of everything
* added command-line options for specifying the TCP port for both the client and server contexts
* added camconfig .xml files
* added TTL for multicast packets, and updated some wrappers
* use cppintrospection 3.0
* document ShapeNode, TextureStateSetFinder, spinApp, PointerNodeActionAdapter, NodeSearcher, Fog
* removed ^M characters
* list all spin nodes at startup
* add Menu3D and AttractorNode
* add some features to TextNode
* added ReporterNode
* added bounce and collide events for ConstraintsNode

Bugs fixed:

* TIMECODE CHANGE: now using double precision milliseconds
* fixed bug when compiling spin without spatosc
* fixed autoconf macro for python so that it detects python 2.7 properly (Natty)
* disallowed spinserver to start with automatic port if user manually specifies a port that is already taken. Instead, we quit with an error message
* fixed nodelist sending to multiple clients (but only for UDP. Still need to fix TCPvi src/spin/spinApp.cpp )
* fixed buffer accumulation bug with SharedVideoTexture (un-assigned textures were not updating, and thus, not eating frames)
* using glibtool instead of libtool on OSX
* fixed a few old osgIntrospection keyworkds
* needed to set a function as an extern "C"
* fixed memleak spinBaseContext
* ignoring lighting for ShapeNodes with statesets
* fixed test - not launching a listener
* ensuring that QuatToEuler reports angles in range of -PI to PI
* progress with signal handling for editor, and ported the TTL stuff from svn version of spin
* more forward declaration
* removed check for fmod
* ViewerManipulator: fixed endless loop
* fixed saving of statesets in xml, and moved towards proper .app bundles for OSX
* Changed spinviewer to use pollUpdates() method, sharing a single thread with OSG
* spinviewer::run should return 0
* Use ports and addresses in spinDefaults. Update multicast group to 239.0.0.1


2010-07-22 : spinframework 0.3.2
--------------------------------
This release is in the development series 0.3.x that has an unstable API. It introduces
many bug fixes and new features. We changed the UDP multicast group to 226.0.0.1 for the 
info and scene message channels. We fixed a lot of bugs regarding the shared video texture
using the Scenic milhouse video streaming utility. 

New features:

* Added a TCP channel for important messages to the spinserver
* Renamed spinserver and spinviewer to lowercase
* Implemented the --version option in spinserver and spinviewer
* Created man pages for spinserver and spinviewer
* Introducing the server side Python scripting
* big refactoring of spinContext
* updated multicast group to 226.0.0.1
* created RELEASE, AUTHORS and NEWS files
* using POSIX/GNU-style options for spinserver and spinviewer
* Using /SPIN/__user__ for user subscription
* Using left-hand coordinates for both rotations and translations
* don't need to configure with --enable-scenic, if it's detected it will be used 

Bugs fixed:

* fixed sync signal to be double float in ms
* updates to autoconf for Ubuntu Lucid
* fixed `make dist`
* updated glut m4
* made spin context functions non global
* got rid of -Wstrict-prototypes in python cflags
* comment out fmod
* added -Wfatal-errors to flags
* don't use using namespace std
* moved python scripts into Resources directory
* fixed rm rule in osgwrappers
* fixed spinviewer cleanup problem by using a joinable thread rather than a detached thread
* fixed the way that statesets are cleared (clearStates) message 
* added more aggressive interrupt handler 
* #12 Removed the src/deprecated directory from the trunk
* added non-blocking keyboard input to example so that ctrl-c works 
* fixed memory leaks in shared video texture 
* fixed thread scheduling issue in shared video texture
